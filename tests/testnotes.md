Oh hi Mark (do you get that a lot?)

1/6/2023
    Done today:
    - started boiler plating
    - scripts: added jesttest as a script in package.json
        "test" was already taken
    - made test folder (you're in it) and this notes file
    - installed jest as dev dependency
    - made one boilerplate test

    Questions
    - issues with jest and typescript?
    - come up with the tests we need for front and back
